# Twitter-Sentiment-Analysis-Using-NLP
As a Part of my Research Assistant role under Prof. Tarasewich I am working on Twitter Sentiment Analysis of Airline Data. Segregating the Negative tweets and finding out the services/tags that are pointed out by the users is the main task of the project

•	Performed Data Extraction of different airline tweets using Twint (Twitter Scraping Tool) to understand the consumer’s voice
•	Implemented NLP techniques like Stemming, Lemmatization and Vectorization to process the data
•	Analyzed the sentiment of tweets using TextBlob to categorize them as positive, negative, and neutral
